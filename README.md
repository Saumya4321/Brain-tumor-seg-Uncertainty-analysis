# Analyzing effect of different augmentation techniques on Brain Tumor Segmentation 

## Overview
This study proposes a modified U-Net incorporating focal loss to address
class imbalance and Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty
estimation, providing interpretable predictions. The model
was evaluated on MRI data, with experiments focusing on
focal loss parameter tuning and studying the impact of three
data augmentation techniques: Horizontal Flip, Rotation,
and Scaling.
